## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Running football_pool database

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
# Create .env with DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT, APP_ENV
cp .env.example .env

# Build
npm run build

# Start API server
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd backend/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Deployment Notes

If the site loads in production but shows no data, the frontend is usually pointing at the wrong API URL.

- **Same host / reverse proxy deployment:** leave `VITE_API_BASE_URL` blank so the app uses relative `/api/...` calls.
- **Separate frontend + backend deployments:** set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://<your-backend-host>` when building the frontend.
- For Render backend deployments, also set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `APP_ENV=production`, then run the SQL migrations before opening the site.

### Run Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Apply migrations to the isolated test database
npm run db:migrate:test
```

> Automated tests only use the dedicated `TEST_DATABASE_URL` / `*_test` database and will now **refuse to touch your development data** if that isolated database is unavailable.
>
> First-time local setup: create a separate test database such as `devdb_test`, or point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at any safe isolated PostgreSQL database. Use `npm run db:migrate:test` instead of temporarily overriding `DATABASE_URL` in your shell.

### Clean Local Data Quickly

```bash
cd backend

# Wipe local development data but keep migrations and reference sport teams
npm run db:clean

# Wipe the dedicated automated test database
npm run db:clean:test
```

These cleanup commands preserve `football_pool.schema_migrations` and the seeded `football_pool.sport_team` catalog, while removing mutable test/dev data like users, pools, games, squares, winnings, notifications, and uploaded images.

### Display Links
- Every pool gets an automatically generated `display_token`.
- Basic display launch URL:
  - `http://localhost:5173/?display=<display_token>`
- Optional display query parameters:
  - `refresh=<seconds>` - auto-refresh interval in seconds (minimum `5`, default `30`)
  - `tz=<IANA timezone>` - timezone used for the display header and updated timestamp, for example `America/Chicago`
- Example display URLs:
  - `http://localhost:5173/?display=<display_token>`
  - `http://localhost:5173/?display=<display_token>&refresh=15&tz=America/Chicago`
- The display view is optimized for TVs / projectors and hides menus, sign-in, pool/game selectors, and payout schedule details.
- The display screen now includes a scoreboard-style header, auto-refresh polling, and still listens for live score updates through SSE.
- Optional advertising mode can periodically shrink the display board to make space for sponsor content on the right and bottom of the screen.
- Display advertising is now managed in the organizer **Marketing** section, where you can enable ads, control the rotation cadence, and maintain image/text creatives.
- If `tz` is omitted, the frontend uses `VITE_DISPLAY_TIME_ZONE` when configured, otherwise it falls back to the display device's local browser timezone.
- Frontend environment defaults for display mode:
  - `VITE_DISPLAY_REFRESH_SECONDS=30`
  - `VITE_DISPLAY_TIME_ZONE=America/Chicago`
- `GET /api/landing/display/:displayToken` - Resolve a public read-only board payload for the linked pool

## Authentication

### Development Mode
Use request headers for testing:
- `x-user-id`: User ID
- `x-user-role`: `organizer`, `participant`, or `player`

### Production Mode
Use JWT tokens:
1. Call `POST /api/auth/login` with email/password
2. Receive JWT token in response
3. Include in requests: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Key Features Explained

### Square Assignment
- 100 squares per pool (rows 0-9, columns 0-9)
- Automatic conflict detection (prevents double assignment)
- Reassignment support with explicit flag
- Last-digit matching for winner calculation

### Winner Calculation
Score: 24-28
- Last digit of score: 4
- Last digit of opponent: 8
- Winning square: Row 8, Column 4 (square #85)
- Q1-Q4 payouts defined per pool

### Logging
- All HTTP requests logged: `[timestamp] METHOD PATH -> STATUS (Xms)`
- Square assignments logged: `[square-assignment] request/saved` with payloads
- Ingestion scheduler and run outcomes logged: `[score-ingest] ...`
- View logs in backend terminal during development

### Ingestion Configuration
Optional backend `.env` settings:
- `SCORE_INGEST_ENABLED=false` - Starts the automatic scheduler on boot when `true`
- `SCORE_INGEST_SOURCE=mock` - `mock`, `payload`, or `espn`
- `SCORE_INGEST_DAILY_START_HOUR_CT=6` - Daily wake-up hour in Central Time
- `SCORE_INGEST_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30` - Low-frequency polling cadence before games go live
- `SCORE_INGEST_ACTIVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60` - Faster cadence while games are close to kickoff or live
- `SCORE_INGEST_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=8000` - Timeout per ESPN request
- `SCORE_INGEST_PRIMARY_TEAM=` - Optional team hint used for ESPN game matching
- `SIMULATION_ENABLED=true` - Enables organizer simulation tools on the backend
- `VITE_ENABLE_SIMULATION_CONTROLS=true` - Shows simulation controls in the frontend
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` - Turns notification delivery on/off globally
- `EMAIL_FROM`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP settings used for winner and live-leader emails; if `SMTP_HOST` is blank, the app logs the email payload instead

### Live Score Update Process
The live score flow is designed to scale across many pools while keeping ESPN/API usage low.

1. **Daily wake-up at 6:00 AM CT**
   - The scheduler starts each day at `SCORE_INGEST_DAILY_START_HOUR_CT`.
   - If no pool-linked games are scheduled for that day, it goes back to sleep until the next morning.

2. **Only today’s games are monitored**
   - The scheduler looks at the shared game schedule for the current day rather than polling every pool separately.
   - This keeps work proportional to actual NFL activity.

3. **Adaptive polling**
   - Before kickoff, polling stays relatively slow (`SCORE_INGEST_INTERVAL_MINUTES`).
   - Once a game is near kickoff or in progress, polling increases to the faster live interval (`SCORE_INGEST_ACTIVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`).
   - After the last game completes, the scheduler sleeps until the next day.

4. **Shared central game updates**
   - Scores are applied to the shared game record that all pools reference.
   - Winner and payout processing only re-runs when the score/state actually changed, which reduces unnecessary database work.

5. **Push-style frontend refreshes via SSE**
   - The backend publishes `game-updated` and scheduler status events on `GET /api/ingestion/events`.
   - Open organizer, display-only, and participant boards listen to that stream and automatically refresh when their selected game changes.

This approach avoids constant browser polling, reduces repeated ESPN requests, and scales better as more pools are added.

### Simulation Modes
Use **Pool Maintenance** to start the simulation, then use the **Score Ingestion** page to advance it when applicable.

- **Full Year**
  - Current one-click behavior.
  - Assigns all 100 squares, randomizes row/column numbers for every game, and fills the season with simulated scores immediately.

- **By Game**
  - Assigns squares and prepares only the first game initially.
  - Use **Complete Game** to fetch ESPN scores when available; if ESPN is unavailable, the app automatically uses a mock score and notifies you.
  - After the game completes, the next game is automatically prepared.

- **By Quarter**
  - Assigns squares and prepares only the first game initially.
  - Use **Complete Quarter** to fetch the next posted ESPN quarter when available; if not, the app automatically uses a mock quarter score and notifies you.
  - After quarter 4 is completed, the app automatically advances to the next game.

This is mainly intended for demo and testing flows so the board can be watched as a season progresses gradually instead of completing all at once.
